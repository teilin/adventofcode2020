# Advent of code 2020

Collection of puzzles every day in Descember 2020. Each day contains of two parts, part 1 and part 2. I solve the puzzles that I have time to solve and challenge myself by using programming languages that I curious about. I started doing the puzzles in [2019](https://github.com/teilin/adventofcode2019), but since I also did another advent code calendar I did not get enough time to this one.

# Stars

When a puzzle get solved, the system give a start. This is a summary of the stars that I collect when I go through the puzzles.
